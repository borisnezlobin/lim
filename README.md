L!m
</h1>

L!m is a RegEx-based time limit extension for Firefox (with Chrome to be delivered!). Block websites en masse with the power of RegEx, or set website-specific limits by simply typing in the domain. Be as creative as you want about how you block websites â€” it's up to you!

## Key features + Roadmap:

- Delayed Delete: trying to delete a limit? You'll have to wait until the next day to confirm it!
- Emergency Minutes: 5 extra minutes... across all of your limits!
- Usage: L!m gives you a daily breakdown of time spent across websites.
